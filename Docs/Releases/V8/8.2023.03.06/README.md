# Version 8 : Release 2023 March 6th

## V8.2023.03.06

### About

This was a minor update that was heavily delayed by over 3 months. It includes the followng changes:

- [x] The branches [`Template-Other`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Git-Template_V8/tree/Template-Other/) and [`Template-SNU-Programming-Tools`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Git-Template_V8/tree/Template-SNU-Programming-Tools/) have the following 2 additions: `AUTOMATE2001.yaml` and `/OldVersions/AUTOMATE2001/AUTOMATE2001_V1.yaml`
- [x] The 404 files were added to the root of the [`main`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Git-Template_V8/tree/main/) branch to signal what language the sub-branches will first start out with, and so that it matches the rest of the branches.

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project anymore.
